# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
IIT ISM Dhanbad offers a Master's program in Mathematics and Computing, which includes practical components in its curriculum. For the 3rd semester of the 2023-25 academic session, students enrolled in this program will engage in various practical applications related to Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms (DAA). 

The practical coursework is designed to enhance students' understanding of theoretical concepts through hands-on experience, focusing on algorithm design, analysis, and implementation. Students will work on projects that involve real-world applications of mathematical theories and computational techniques, preparing them for careers in software development, data analysis, and research.

This semester's practical sessions will include:
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Students will implement various algorithms to solve computational problems.
- **Data Structures**: Practical exercises will focus on the application of different data structures in programming.
- **Performance Analysis**: Students will analyze the efficiency of their algorithms and optimize them accordingly.

Overall, the practical component aims to provide students with a robust skill set that combines theoretical knowledge with practical expertise in mathematics and computing.
